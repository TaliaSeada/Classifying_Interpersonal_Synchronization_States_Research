### Synchronization between humans is of crucial importance in creating social relationships and interacting with the environment • Until now, scientists believed that speed is an essential factor in synchronization between people, but new research reveals that location is also critical • Research leader: "We believe that our development can help diagnose "Early Autism"
Synchronization between people is of crucial importance in our social relationships. People on the autistic spectrum sometimes have difficulty reading social situations - and synchronizing with others. A new Israeli study published in Scientific Reports from Nature presents a new picture of how humans synchronize with each other and estimates that its results may help in the early diagnosis of autism and even "train" those dealing with it to better understand the environment. The leader of the research: "We believe that our development can help in the early diagnosis of autism."

The concept of synchronization is quite simple: two people who are interacting, having a conversation, or even being present together in a certain place, start imitating each other. It reaches the level where the two feel that they are in a kind of flow of synchronization between them. This can be seen, for example, when two people are talking and their body language becomes similar: they move their hands to mirror the movements of their conversation partner. 

In fact, it is difficult to exaggerate the importance of the ability to synchronize - it is a significant part of the way in which babies grow, learn, communicate with the environment, and make friends. In workplaces, groups that have a good synchronization between them, work more efficiently and bring better results and in the marital world, this is a feature that can really define the nature of the relationship.

"When I try to explain to people what 'synchronization' means between two people, I like to give the following example," says Dr. Roy Yozevitz, director of the Applied Machine Learning Laboratory at Ariel University, "Think of a couple dancing in wonderful harmony but each It is certain that the other leads the dance. The synchronization between the two is what actually leads the dance."

## Position instead of speed
So far, scientists have believed that speed is an important factor in synchronizing between people, that is, the movement speed of two people is synchronized when they are interacting. Now a new study led by Dr. Roy Yozevitz found that another important factor is the location of each of the conversation partners. "People feel more coordinated when they are on the same plane. If my hand is up and yours is down - it won't feel right, even when we are at the same speed. That's why we try to compensate - I want to be in the same position with another person, so I correct my speed," he says to N12.

The researchers used special depth cameras and advanced image processing algorithms - which allowed for more free and authentic movement between the subjects and also much higher accuracy at the level of measurement. In research, it is accepted that synchronization is defined according to how much the speed of the two participants is coordinated. Due to the fact that they used artificial intelligence tools, the researchers could see the real patterns – how people really behave when asked to synchronize with each other. They found that it is not the speed that plays a role but the location. If your partner's hand is higher or lower than yours, you will feel out of sync even if you are moving at the same speed.

Dr. Yozevitz says: "We defined two different synchronization modes. The first is a conscious state in which we asked the subjects to try to be in sync with each other without giving detailed instructions. But the second situation is more interesting in which the subjects were not asked to go into conscious synchronization but simply to move in front of each other. This situation is called spontaneous synchronization because, for normal humans, it is very difficult to move in front of another person without considering the movements of the other at all. And indeed we have seen that spontaneous synchronization always occurs in healthy people. Another interesting point is that as the level of synchronization increases, the speed also decreases, but the distance between the subjects also decreases - each enters more into the other's personal space."

## "Coach" for autism and early diagnosis
According to Dr. Yozevitz, beyond the scientific importance of understanding the neurological mechanisms that underlie our ability to understand the other, the implications of this research are no less interesting: "We know today that people on the autistic spectrum experience severe problems in their ability to synchronize and "read intentions" of who stands in front of them. One of the main problems in autism is the inability to see reality through the eyes of the other.

A point that is at the base of interpersonal synchronization. A similar phenomenon, with a different intensity, of course, exists in people diagnosed with ADHD. "We believe that the algorithm we developed can, in the first stage, help in the early diagnosis of these syndromes," explains Dr. Yozevitz. "And in the second stage, function as a kind of coach for those people on how to better synchronize with the other by means of immediate feedback."

Also participating in the study were Dr. Anat Dahan from the Academic College of Engineering in Rauda Karmiel, Dr. Hila Gebirtz from Ariel University, and the students Daniel Appel and Talia Seada. As part of the research, they used tools from the world of artificial intelligence to analyze the phenomenon: they taught an algorithm to recognize when people are in sync and thus, as Yozevich says, "let the data tell the story."
